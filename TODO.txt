- weird problem with onScreen() check??

- load up a bunch of different thoughts
	- still need a few more!!
	- made it up through the M group

- shuffle "thoughts" into subsets

- need to prevent thoughts from appearing too close to the player!

- put instructions on the title screen

- death animation for squash class

- credits screen

- maybe use the particles to do some simple collectibles?

- sound effects?





"Make a game about a lost thought trying to find it's way back"

so each time you start a new game, you're playing a different day dream.
you're trying to guide a specific thought back "home".
maybe can subtly do a compass via background art/motion?
so this would be a top down kind of thing
and you're trying to find your way to the center
which means you would start kind of on the outside. . .
going toward the edge should ease you back but also do a darkness fading thing

soooo you're in a kind of big circular space and you're trying to get to the middle
could have maybe like captain forever, sort of threatening kinds of dreams?
maybe you sort of gobble up little ideas to survive or push through later encounters?
maybe being bigger makes you slower?  would be cool to have choice to stay small and fast
but how would you indicate scale/speed in a reasonable way?  through background art?
